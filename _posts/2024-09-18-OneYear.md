Ok, I didnt even realise it.
==============================
Now I did not expect to be checking discord user profile age for an assignment and I noticed it said:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/blog/OneYear/discord.png){: w="935" h="1132" }


Today as of writing it is Wednesday, 18, September, 2024. In 5 Days CitrusIntellect will be one year old.

Up until this point I would like to say thank you everyone, for everything.

What is next?
=============
I have alot plannned for the future.
