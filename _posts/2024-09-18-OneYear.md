Ok, I didnt even realise it.
==============================
Now I did not expect to be checking discord user profile age for an assignment and I noticed it said:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/blog/OneYear/discord.png){: w="935" h="1132" }


Today as of writing it is Wednesday, 18, September, 2024. In 5 Days CitrusIntellect will be one year old.

Up until this point I would like to say thank you everyone, for everything.

What is next?
=============
I have alot plannned for the future. Just wait and see is all I can see.


More background
===============
This is where I will put my true history about me.

I used to be under the identity of OrangeGlowest.
I left that identity becuase of Harassment I was getting at school over the internet and irl (Bullying and Cyberbullying) So I left OrangeGlowest and became CitrusIntellect.

My past is behind me now and the people who were harassing me are now (most of them) on my side.
CitrusIntellect was my new starting point in life.
