Why bring AI up?
================
AI is used everywhere for selling points, like it is the next big thing. But AI is mis understood, there is alot to talk about here.
This will be every technical but only to teach you on this topic. I use AI alot to help me as a I am technically considered a "script kiddie".
I am not about to spend many hours learning coding languages when I can study.



The Basics.
===========
AI, or Artifical Intellegence (or you Apple fans, Apple Intellegence) is a main catagory for may things, for example, ChatGPT is considered AI, Bing AI is considered, well, AI. Most movies demonstrates AI as a killer robot, or something that is better than a human. They are true, but those movies are talking about ASI, or Artifical Super Intellegence. Lets think of AI Like a Main File system (Like C: or /), The top, Artifical Intellegence. The first subpath is Artifical Narrow Intellegence, or ANI. The next subpath under C: or / is Artifical General Intellegence or AGI. And the last subpath under C: or / is Artifical Super Intellegence, or ASI. There are many diffrences between these layers which I will now go in depth to them next.

The Layers of AI.
================

# Artifical Narrow Intellegence (ANI)
Artifical Narrow Intellegence is what we are at today, is able to complete one thing really well, potentially faster than humans can. You may be asking your self, what about ChatGPT. Well ChatGPT is good at one thing only, Text based generation, nothing more. More into ChatGPT as an example for the next thing under this.

> Before reading the rest, it is recommended to read the LLM's subsection for context
{: .prompt-tip }

Now What if something the ANI is asked is not in its training data? Well the ANI algorithm will sometimes incorrectly decode the task at hand. In other words, it will "hallucinate" the response, causing something that is not true to be generated and is completely incorrect. More about is on [IBM's article on the topic](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-hallucinations)

ANI is what we are at today, It can't learn from anything but its training data. And cant debug stuff by its self if the error is not in its training data.

## Large Language Models (LLM)
Large Language Models or LLM is a collection of data. This data is what runs the ANI's like ChatGPT, Bing AI, etc. LLM's are trained with training data, in the case for GPT-1, thousands of books, GPT-2 (and so on), the internet. These LLM's are usually trained with GPU's or Graphics Processing Units. These are good for running and training LLM's becuase they have thousands or cores. More details about GPU cores vs CPU cores can be found [on intels article about the topic](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/cpu-vs-gpu.html)


# Artifical General Intellegence (AGI)
Artifical General Intellegence, or AGI, is a concept that we could achive in the future. AGI is basically ANI however, AGI can learn by it's self without training data. Basically creating a human brain without any emotiions or feelings. This is the type of AI subsection that will take your job's when it is first made. This type of AI can figure out problems by it's self and add to data it can use in the future. Right now this is a concept that some people are working twords. There is alot unknown but we are slowly reaching this type of AI.

# Artifical Superintellegence (ASI)
Ok you movie fans, Artifical Superintellegence is the type of AI that is a human. ASI can  think, reason, learn, make judgements and possess cognitive abilities that surpass those of human beings. This is the AI that the movies depict. This is strictly theoretical. If ever reached we could be in trouble. Since this is so far out, I dont have much to say about this.



Controversal AI Topics
======================

# Microsoft 

Recall, or in otherwords, a privacy nightmare, is (or was) a feature on Windows devices that every 5 minutes, would screenshot your computer so you can go back to it at a later point. Take a minute here, Microsoft already has been proven to collect and sell user data. They say recall would be thing on local devices only. Yea no, I dont belive it. The terms of Windows states that whenever Microsoft wants to, they can restart your computer for updates. Like Microsoft Edge could actually be uninstalled at one point, but becuase Microsoft has forced updates to make this very difficult. Now they say Recall would be a local thing, but as I said, whenever Microsoft wants to, they can restart your computer for an update, they could then, force enable Recall, or change recall to send data back to Microsoft. Now I dont know everything on the topic, but that is what I know.


# Devin
Devin is an AI that is emulating a software developer. Devin has an entire workflow with a terminal, coding space, and the ability to generate code and change it to try to fix errors. Devin is controversal as it could take the job of software developer and take peoples jobs away. That is an issue, luckly, its not used much.

# Other ones
There are alot more but I wont list them here.


Final Words
===========
AI is understood and people need to learn what AI is. Please share this post to other people to spread the word of what AI is. Thank you for reading and have a good day!
