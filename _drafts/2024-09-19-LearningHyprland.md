What is Hyprland?
=================

[Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) is a Tiling Wayland Compositor that the user has to configure by them self, Heh, its like Arch Linux. Hyprland is just a Compositor, NOT a desktop environment. The diffrent is that a Wayland Compositor uses a bunch of keybinds compaired
to a traditional Desktop Environment (Like KDE). Hyprland usually only has a few features, but hyprland is mostly paired with alot of other apps like [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar), \
[Swaylock - Lock Screen](https://github.com/swaywm/swaylock), [Wofi - App Launcher](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi), [Kitty - Terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), etc.

This can lead to well over 10 config files per install. (I have about 20 config files).


> If you cant already tell, hyprland is a "Do it yourself" GUI (NOT DE) similar to Arch Linux, please gain an understanding on how hyprland works before attempting to install.

Why would you use Hyprland?
===========================

There are many advantages to using hyprland, for 1. You can customize to your heart's consent. Unlike KDE, almost anything is possible as you can add extra functionality (officially supported) to hyprland. 2. Preformance, even though hyprland
looks very resource heavy, it actually is not that heavy compaired to a Desktop Environment like KDE Desktop becuase hyprland is not a service but an executable, all of the plugins are executables, there are very little serivces for hyprland to work
properly. 3. The community is huge, there is custom installers (Not reccomended) that people can use to help other people install quickly and get the idea of Hyprland.

> I dont reccomend Custom installers for daily use, because everyone's system is diffrent, stuff can and will easily break. I used a custom config's as a base, which is diffrent to an installer.

Where are your configs?
=======================
Well they will be on my [Github](github.com/CitrusIntellect) in a few days. I will update this when it is ready as I have multiple devices running hyprland + arch linux.

I am running Hyprland on my Rooted Chromebook with Arch Linux and my main PC, which is taking a bit to configure.
Note, I used [Arch-Everforest](https://github.com/3rfaan/arch-everforest/tree/main?) configs as my base, please give support to the original creator.

> Please note, do not use my configs on your main pc. Modify my configs first before using them as my configs can easily break your install.

Rooted Chromebook
=================
Yes I said that right. My chromebook is rooted. In the future I will post about it but It will take a bit. If your wondering I used [Mr. Chromebox's Method](https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/) for rooting
To note Rooting your chromebook can destroy your chromebook. I am running Arch Linux (With Archinstall) on my chromebook. I used arch install as I needed this chromebook up as fast as possible as I use it for school.
